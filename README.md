### **Business Idea: AI Tools Aggregator Website**

**What it is**:  
A simple, well-organized website that lists and categorizes trending AI tools (like ChatGPT, Midjourney, Runway, ElevenLabs, etc.) with descriptions, use-cases, and affiliate/referral links.

---

### **Why this works**:
- **High search demand**: People are searching for the best AI tools daily.
- **Zero backend**: Static HTML/JS site is enough.
- **Low competition** in niche categories (e.g., “AI tools for real estate,” “AI tools for teachers”)
- **Monetizable** via:
  - Affiliate links (many tools have referral programs)
  - Sponsored listings
  - Newsletter subscriptions (using free services like Mailchimp)
  - Ads (once you have traffic)

---

### **Structure of the website**:
- **Homepage**: Clean layout with categories (Design, Writing, Coding, Video, etc.)
- **Tool Pages**: Each tool has a separate card with:
  - Logo
  - Description
  - Features
  - Pricing
  - Link to tool (with affiliate/referral tag)
- **Search & Filter**: Add simple JS search functionality
- **Blog (Optional)**: Add tutorials like “Top 10 AI Tools for YouTubers” (great for SEO)

---

### **Bonus**:  
Later, you can expand it into:
- An AI tool comparison site
- Add AI-generated content/blogs
- Let users upvote tools (use Firebase or simple JSON for storage)

   - Many tools offer free trials, deals, or lifetime offers.
